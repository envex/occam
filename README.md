# Occam

Control the colors of your Synapse 3 Razer devices from the macOS toolbar.

With Synapse 3 being unsupported on macOS, your devices default to cycling colors. With occam you can set the individual color of each device.

Currently we use a custom built version of [FruityRazer](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityRazer) to support the Goliathus and Mamba Wireless.

### Currently Supported Devices

- Razer Huntsman Elite
- Razer Mamba Wireless
- Razer Goliathus Mousepad
